Battleships for web
===

Objectives
---

In week 5 at Makers Academy we were divided into teams of five to build on the previous week's Ruby Battleships code. The week introduced us to Sinatra, along with basic HTML and CSS. The game was built using sessions, which was cutting-edge for our knowledge at the time, even if I wouldn't build it that way with what I know now.

Status
---

- The backend code is finished, and placing ships on a visual board works.
- Playing the game itself is implemented in a basic way, but not working as intended yet.
- The game knows when one player is victorious.
- Next step would be to fix the sessions and polish off the web interface, but really I'd like to start again from scratch with the knowledge I have today.
